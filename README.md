# Premo

Premo is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that helps you implement the Presentation Layer and share it on iOS and Android. 

Focus on writing logic instead of solving common and boring UI related issues:
- **Lifecycle**
- **Persistence**
- **Navigation**

At the same time, the library provides freedom of choice:
- **Architecture** — MVVM, PM, MVI or other.
- **UI** — Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS.

## Sample

[Sample](https://github.com/dmdevgo/Premo/tree/master/sample) demonstrates:
- Sharing presentation logic between Android and iOS.
- Using StateFlow to implement MVVM (PM).
- Simple Counter.
- Stack and Bottom navigation with multistack.
- Saving and restoring the state after killing the process.
- UI on Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI.
